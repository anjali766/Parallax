     <h2> <br>ABOUT</h2>
     <p> <br>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate 
         change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.<br><br>

        Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a
         blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.<br><br>
        
        Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate 
        change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal
         for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. 
         Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy,
         industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.</p>

    <h2 float="center"> <br>CAUSES </h2>
    <p> <br>Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's
         temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock.<br>

        This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally 
        occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.<br><br>
    <h5>Greenhouse Effect</h5><br>
    The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space and causing global warming.

    Many of these greenhouse gases occur naturally, but human activity is increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere, in particular:
    <br>
    ->carbon dioxide (CO2)<br>
    ->methane<br>
    ->nitrous oxide<br>
    ->fluorinated gases<br><br>
<h5> Global Warming</h5><br>
2011-2020 was the warmest decade recorded, with global average temperature reaching 1.1°C above
 pre-industrial levels in 2019. Human-induced global warming is presently increasing at a rate of
  0.2°C per decade.<br>
An increase of 2°C compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times is associated with serious 
negative impacts on to the natural environment and human health and wellbeing, including a much higher risk that dangerous
 and possibly catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur.<br>
 <h5> Pollution</h5>
 <br>Global warming, also known as climate change, is caused by a blanket of pollution 
 that traps heat around the earth. This pollution comes from cars, factories, homes, and power 
 plants that burn fossil fuels such as oil, coal, natural gas, and gasoline. Global warming pollution
  knows no boundaries.it leads to<br>
  ->Air pollution<br>
  ->Water pollution<br>
  ->Land pollution<br></p>

    <h2> <br>PRECAUTIONS</h2>
    <p><br><br>It is widely accepted around the world that human activity is affecting Earth's climate. From air pollution to modern society's fondness of throwing stuff away, humans are not acting as the best custodians for planet Earth. 
<br><br>
        However, with a little effort, each of us can do our part in reducing climate change. 
    <br> Some of the steps we can take are:<br><br>
-> Say no to plastic<br>
-> Renewable to Rescue<br>
-> Whenever possible,use public transport<br>
-> Switch to electric cars<br>
-> Stop chopping down forests<br> </p>
